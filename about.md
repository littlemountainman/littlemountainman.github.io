## The present:
Student, working on autonomous vehicles in simulation and reality. Interested in Drug Discovery and computational neuroscience. 

## The past:
I am currently a student working on programming projects since I am 12 years old. Back then I was learning HTML with a good friend of mine. We were trying to sell those websites we made but with fairly little success.Around 4 years ago I stumbled across Python. And I immediately fell in love with it. Later 2015 I was impressed by the Google Assistant. I wanted to build something similar to that. So that was the point when I started with Machine and Deep Learning.
So I have been doing that since then in my free time besides school.Back then I was starting with the at the time fairly complicated Tensorflow(at least for a newbie). Ever since I made different models for computer vision and natural language Processing.
